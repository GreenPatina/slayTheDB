## What is Slay The DB?
This is a repository containing code of the ETL pipeline for creating a PostgreSQL database containing cleaned and normalised data from the Slay the Spire dataset found at the following link:

The goal of this repository is to train and demonstrate various database and data engineering skills for myself. An equally important goal is to help others do research on good clean, and valid data, having already gone through the steps of cleaning, validating and otherwise optimising a raw dataset.
