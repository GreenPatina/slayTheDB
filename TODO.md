1. Organise the json repository into subdirectories for reading as batches.
2. Use a small batch to create persistent db schema.
3. Write functionality to interatively read additional batches of jsons and add them to the existing db.

5. Figure out how to export resulting schema into other databases (e.g. postgres).
